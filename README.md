# Protein-Classification-using-R
Aim:
Apply classification techniques for predicting novel kinase-substrates. Given a small set of positive labelled data

Data sets:
InsulinPhospho.txt (12,062 Observations and 16 features)
Akt Substrates (22 Observations) ~known samples
mTor Substrates (26 Observations) ~known samples
AUC_Ins.txt (12062 and 3 features) : AUC_Ins has no extra information, it is actually a subset of InsulinPhospho.txt

Experimented with feature generation and selection to improve model performance
Applied AdaSampling to positive unlabelled sample problem
Benchmarked performance using metrics
Compared to prior work
